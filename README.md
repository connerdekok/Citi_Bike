When examining the bike start data for New York metropolitan area on September 18th 2024 I was able to correlate a variety of trends by condensing the data.
When looking at the city bike stations that were the most popular on this specific day it was found that the Hoboken Terminal on River St and Hudson Pl were the most popular. 
With a total of 6,528 uses as a starting point when the second most used station the Grove St Path Terminal was used 4,969 times to start trips.
When doing some further investigation as to why this may be the case it because Hoboken is the home to the Citi Bike system, so essentially a giant hub for bike share systems. 
Also, Hoboken as a city is incredibly bike friendly to its citizens and visitors alike.  Hoboken is also centrally located in New Jersey as well as incredibly close to Manhattan.
When examining some reasons why Grove Path may have had a high volume of traffic it seems to be in an incredibly safe area as well as located near lots of bike paths that will take you directly into New York City.
It also is the first underground PATH station from the Newark to WTC line, in turn making it incredibly convenient to use.  

When examining the average ride length throughout every station the South Waterfront Walkway had the highest average ride length with an average of 15.3 minutes per ride.
This station is located directly next to a marina, a park, and views of the river. 
These could be some reasons as to why it has a higher ride length than others for riders to get out and spend time in nature.  

Also viewing the all station map it helps show the most common starting locations of all the city bike stations and helps show that most of the commonly used stations are the most centrally located ones,
and are also generally closer to Manhattan.  When viewing the most common end stations they are also most of the same stations that were used as the most common starting station.
This makes sense as people would generally pick up and drop off at the same station throughout their trips.    


Thirdly, when viewing the least used bike stations on September 18th 2024 the Grant Ave & MLK Drive station was the least used with a total of 60 total trips started here.
When looking into this it seems to be a rougher area compared to some of the more popular Citi bike areas. 
This could be a reason why it sees less bike traffic compared to other surrounding areas. 
Also it seems to be in a more residential area away from attractions and businesses. 
This does influence the ride length here with the average ride length being 27.8 minutes which makes more sense in a residential area. 

The dashboards created help viewers examine the data from a variety of charts including a bar chart, pie chart, and city map to help visualize where the stations are located. 
The pie chart shows each station used as a part of the whole percentage compared to each other station. 
While the bar chart helps compare the total starting numbers at each station. 
When viewing the map of Newark it shows each station with its location on the map with a variety of interesting data points such as the location as a latitude and longitude,
the average ride length, and count of casual members that used that bike station in a given day. 
The map also shows a different sized icon based on the average ride length with a larger icon indicating a longer ride. 
As well as a darker icon meaning a higher count of casual members who had used the station. 

The top 10 start and end maps also have an option be sorted out by month and years that the user wants to find. 

To conclude, when examining information such as each location total start amounts, and ride length it helps riders and city
officials see where more bike stations should be located to increase revenue and ease of rider use.
